  ║ The Flutter tool uses Google Analytics to anonymously report
  feature usage ║
  ║ statistics and basic crash reports. This data is used to help
  improve      ║
  ║ Flutter tools over time.
  ║
  ║
  ║
  ║ Flutter tool analytics are not sent on the very first run. To
  disable      ║
  ║ reporting, type 'flutter config --no-analytics'. To display the
  current    ║
  ║ setting, type 'flutter config'. If you opt out of analytics, an
  opt-out    ║
  ║ event will be sent, and then no further information will be sent
  by the    ║
  ║ Flutter tool.
